    <h3>About us:</h3>
           <p class="quote"> 
               Founded by Eliza Rennie and George Marriott in 2016, northstreet.collective 
               was designed to create a space in which student artists could showcase 
               their work in a professional, friendly capacity. The collective takes its 
               name from North Street, the name of the street on which the arts building 
               sits in St. Andrews. Both Eliza and George study Art History at the 
               University of St. Andrews in this building on North Street and thus were 
               inspired to use this local, where thier frinedship and shared love of art 
               was founded, as the name for their collaborative collective.
