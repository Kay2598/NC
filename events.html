<h3>past events:</h3>
<br>
Our first event, Rents Due, was held in London in Nov. 2017. We had the honor of 
hosting some amazingly talented young artists from all around the world. Many of whom 
were showcasing their work for the first time. Continuing on this success, we hosted 
our second event in Edinburgh last fall. Again, we were stunned by the quality of our 
artists and loved providing a platform for passionate young people to shine.
